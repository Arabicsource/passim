# passim

This project implements algorithms for detecting and aligning similar
passages in text, either from the command line or the clojure REPL.
It can be run either in query mode, to find quoted passages from a
reference text, or all-pairs mode, to find all pairs of passages
within longer documents with substantial alignments.
